## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="hsnam.png">

I am a research scientist at [Lunit Inc.](https://lunit.io/), working on deep learning with medical images.
I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from [POSTECH](http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/), under the supervision of Prof. [Bohyung Han](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~bhhan/).
During my M.Sc., I pioneered the intersection of deep learning and visual tracking.
Before joining Lunit, I worked as a research engineer at [Naver Labs](https://www.naverlabs.com/en/), developing machine learning applications.
My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, with particular focus on robustness of models in real-world scenarios.
