## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="hsnam.png">

I am a research scientist at [Lunit Inc.](https://lunit.io/), working on deep learning with medical images.
I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from [POSTECH](http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/), under the supervision of Professor [Bohyung Han](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~bhhan/).
During my M.Sc., I focused on the intersection of deep learning and visual tracking.
Before joining Lunit in 2017, I worked as a research engineer at [Naver Labs](https://www.naverlabs.com/en/).
My research interests include computer vision and deep learning with particular focus on robustness and generalization under multi-domain scenarios.
