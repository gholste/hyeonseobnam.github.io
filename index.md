## About Me
<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">


I am a research scientist at [Lunit, Inc.](https://lunit.io/), working on deep learning algorithms for medical images.
I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Professor [Bohyung Han](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~bhhan/).
During my M.Sc., I mainly focused on the intersection of deep learning and visual tracking.
Before joining Lunit in 2017, I worked as a research engineer at [Naver Labs](https://www.naverlabs.com/en/), developing applications of computer vision and machine learning.
My research interests include computer vision and deep learning with particular focus on the robustness of recognition models under a variety of real-world scenarios.
