I am a research scientist at [Lunit Inc.](https://lunit.io/).
I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from [POSTECH](http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/), under the supervision of Professor [Bohyung Han](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~bhhan/).
Before joining Lunit in 2017, I worked as a research engineer at [Naver Labs](https://www.naverlabs.com/en/).
My research interests include computer vision and deep learning with particular focus on the robustness of recognition models under a variety of real-world scenarios.
